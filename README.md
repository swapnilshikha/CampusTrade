CampusTrade is a campus-based marketplace platform that enables students to buy, sell, or exchange products and services within their college community. Built with a modern tech stack, it features:

->Frontend: Developed using React.js and bootstrap for a responsive and dynamic user interface.
->Backend: Powered by Node.js and Express, ensuring efficient handling of server-side logic and API routes.
->Database: Uses MongoDB with Mongoose for seamless data modeling and storage.
->API Testing: Integrated with Postman to test and debug RESTful APIs during development.

This project promotes sustainability, affordability, and peer connectivity by encouraging students to trade items like books, electronics, and more.

I would also like to mention the dependencies for :
1. Backend : npm install, npm i express, npm i mongoose, npm i modemon, npm i multer, npm i dotenv, npm i cors, npm i jsonwebtoken
2. Frontend : npm i bootstrap, npm i react, npm i react-router-dom, npm i axios.

Feel free to contact me for any suggestions, improvements, or collaboration!
